# ðŸ¥¢ `scrape-google-photos`

A command line tool that takes the URL of a public Google Photos album and returns a list of the URLs of the preview-quality images in the album.

This tool could be useful for building a website whose images are hosted on Google Photos. Just create a public Google Photos album, use this tool to aggregate the contained images into a single list, then use that of URLs in your website's JS somewhere.

The fact that this tool outputs non-full quality versions of the images is actually ideal for embedding the images in your website as the preview-quality images are still a reasonably high resolution but will save you bandwidth and give your page high performance.

## ðŸ”Œ Installation
